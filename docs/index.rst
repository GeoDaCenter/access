Spatial Access for PySAL
========================

We are building this pysal package to calculate spatial accessibility from existing travel time matrices.

We have implemented traditional measures -- 
   FCAs (Huff 1963, :cite:`1963_huff_shopping_trade_areas`) along with others.
   2SFCA (Luo and Wang, 2002, :cite:`2002_luo_spatial_accessibility_chicago`), 
   E2SFCA (Luo and Qi 2009, :cite:`2009_luo_qi_E2SFCA`),
   3SFCA (Wan, Zou, and Sternberg, 2012, :cite:`2012_wan_3SFCA`),
   and the Rational Agent Access Model (Saxon and Snow 2019, :cite:`2019_saxon_snow_raam`),

       By distributing our calculation on Amazon Web Services,
         we are able to inexpensively compute an origin-destination driving time matrix
         for tracts within 100 km of each other.
       We also calculate transit time on public transportation, in 40 major cities.
