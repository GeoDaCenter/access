Installation
============

Easy!  

The only dependencies are pandas and numpy.  
Geopandas will allow convenience functions for Euclidean distances, but is not required for core methods.

Note that the library is python 3 only.

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone git@github.com:JamesSaxon/access.git
  cd access/
  python setup.py install
